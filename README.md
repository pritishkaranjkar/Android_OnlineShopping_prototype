# Android_OnlineShopping_prototype

This is a hackathon project which was one of the winning ideas.

On the first screen the app allows users to select an occasion (birthday, marriage anniversary, go camping, etc.)  and the then it pops up a list of things needed for that occasion. User can "check" (select) the items he thinks he will need and click next. From the next screen he can see a listing of all the available items. He can select the items and add to cart and buy it. At the moment the code just shows the functionality up to seeing the listings of the selected items. Need to add the shopping cart and checkout functionality.
